# BirthdayParadox
Introduction:
The birthday paradox is a captivating and counterintuitive phenomenon within probability theory that challenges our expectations regarding shared birthdays in a group. While our intuition might lead us to believe that a large gathering is necessary for such occurrences, the paradox reveals that even in smaller groups, the likelihood of two individuals sharing the same birthday is surprisingly high.

Individual Probability:
At first glance, the probability of two specific individuals sharing a birthday appears low, standing at approximately 1 in 365 for a non-leap year. This forms the foundation of the paradox, as we explore the exponential increase in probability as the size of the group grows.

Cumulative Probability:
As we assemble a group of people, the number of potential pairings increases significantly. It is this multitude of possible combinations that contributes to the counterintuitive nature of the birthday paradox. The probability of shared birthdays within the group rises more rapidly than one might expect.

Threshold for Surprise:
To gauge the surprise factor, we establish a thresholdâ€” a point where the probability of shared birthdays becomes notably high. An often startling revelation is that with just 23 people in a group, there is a greater than 50% chance of at least two individuals sharing the same birthday. This critical point is commonly referred to as the "birthday bound."

Simulation Approach:
In order to explore and demonstrate the birthday paradox, a simulation approach was employed. Virtual groups of people were generated using a random number generator to simulate birthdays. The simulation involved varying the size of the groups and recording instances where at least two individuals shared a birthday.

Results:
The findings of the simulation are presented in the form of tables and graphs, illustrating the relationship between group size and the probability of shared birthdays. This visual representation highlights the rapid increase in probability and emphasizes the point at which the paradox becomes evident.

Real-World Applications:
Optionally, consider discussing real-world applications of the birthday paradox. For instance, its relevance in cryptography, where understanding the probability of collisions is crucial, or in networking scenarios where the likelihood of shared events is a key consideration.
